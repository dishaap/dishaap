- 👋 hey there! i'm dishaap, or disha. i'm a third year student of cognitive sciences in the university of british columbia.
- 👀 i’m interested in AI and UX development. while i am just getting started in these fields, artificial intelligence has always intrigued me - a by-product of growing up on a steady diet of science fiction. i am eager to learn and make a few projects of my own related to these fields!
- 🌱 i’m currently learning python and UX design. game development is also a passion of mine, and i'm slowly getting into it. 
- 💞️ i’m looking to collaborate on a game or any fun project. collaborative projects have never crossed my path but i'm always open to work with other people and learn more.
- 📫 you can reach me through my email, pandurangidisha@gmail.com or my discord: chai#3579 where i usually lurk most times of the day!
